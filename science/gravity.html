  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>Understanding Gravity</h2>
    <p>
    When most people think of gravity, they think of a force that
    keeps keeps things together: it keeps people on the surface of the
    Earth, it keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and it even
    keeps entire galaxies together. This way of thinking about gravity
    &mdash; as a long range force of attraction &mdash; was firmly
    established in the 17th century by Isaac Newton. Newton's law of
    gravity is a spectacular example of how some simple mathematical
    rules can accurately explain what we observe in nature, but it
    isn't the end of the story. By the end of the 19th century, people
    had found several situations in which the classical physical laws,
    such as Newton's law of gravity, didn't quite work. Newton's
    theory isn't totally wrong, but it is incomplete. Few people
    realized just how profoundly a more complete law of gravity would
    change our view of the Universe, but that is exactly what happened
    after Albert Einstein weighed in.
   </p> 
   <p>
   In 1916, Einstein published his general theory of relativity, a
   completely new way of thinking about gravity. In general
   relativity, or GR, we think of gravity as a distortion, or
   curvature, of the fabric of space and time itself (called
   space-time). In this context, space means the distance between two
   objects, or the shortest path you could take to get between point A
   and point B. This is not the same thing as "outer space" &mdash;
   every thing in the Universe exists in space-time, including the
   Earth and everything on (and in) it. In the concept of space-time,
   time refers to that which is measured by clocks.
   </p>
   <p>
   What does this all mean? You can think of space-time as a sheet of
   fabric that is pulled tight (it isn't a perfect analogy, but it is
   the simplest one). Now imagine placing a heavy object like a
   bowling ball on this sheet. The sheet curves around the bowling
   ball, and according to GR, this curvature <em>is</em> gravity. A
   smaller object like a golf ball placed on the sheet will naturally
   fall towards the larger object, and if you give the golf ball a
   little push, it will circle the bowling ball just like a planet
   orbiting a star (friction eventually causes the golf ball to hit
   the bowling ball, but in space this doesn't happen). Anything and
   everything with mass, from stars to actual golf balls, will cause
   space-time to curve, and hence create a gravitational field. This
   may all sound pretty wild, but GR is the most elegant and complete
   description of gravity ever, and it has passed every test that
   scientists have ever put it through. In other words, it works, and
   it works well.
