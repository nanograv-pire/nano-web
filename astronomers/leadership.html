  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>By Laws</h2>
    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>
    The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
    (NANOGrav) is a collaboration of researchers who are actively
    engaged in using North American radio telescopes to detect and
    study gravitational waves via pulsar timing.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to further this purpose, the members of NANOGrav work to
    obtain observing time on relevant telescopes, advance
    instrumentation and algorithms, obtain funding, publish relevant
    research results, and engage their professional colleagues,
    potential sponsors, and the public regarding the detection and
    study of gravitational waves via pulsar timing. NANOGrav is one of
    the founding members of the International Pulsar Timing Array
    (IPTA) and collaborates with its international partners in
    advancing the goal of the detection and study of gravitational
    waves. The foregoing activities illustrate the range, but shall
    not be taken to preclude other activities that would advance the
    purposes of NANOGrav.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Membership</h3>
    <p>
    Membership of NANOGrav is open to any researcher or institution
    that can make a meaningful contribution to furthering the goals of
    NANOGrav. The NANOGrav Membership Policy describes levels of
    Membership and the process by which researchers and institutions
    can join and sustain their Membership in NANOGrav.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Officers</h3>
    <p>
    Officers of NANOGrav shall consist of a Chair, a Management Team,
    and representatives to the IPTA Steering Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Collaboration shall elect a Chair to represent its interests
    to the larger community and to act in an executive capacity for
    the Collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
    All Senior Personnel are eligible to stand for election to the
    position of Chair. The Chair serves for a term of two
    years.<sup>1</sup> A person may serve no more than two consecutive
    terms in the position of Chair, but may be re-elected as Chair at
    a later time. The Chair may designate a member of the Management
    Team to act in his/her absence for a limited duration.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the Chair resigns or is no longer a member, the Management Team
    shall select one of its members to serve in the position of Chair
    until the election can be held. The election to select a person to
    serve the remaining term of the Chair shall be conducted as soon
    as reasonably possible. After completing the remaining term, the
    individual thus elected shall be eligible to stand for only a
    single consecutive subsequent term as Chair.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Management Team for the Collaboration shall be composed of the
    Chair of NANOGrav and four Senior Personnel. The Chair of NANOGrav
    is also the Chair of the Management Team. The Management Team has
    the power to plan future activities, conduct an annual review of
    NANOGrav Membership, arbitrate disputes, and conduct other
    functions that are necessary in order to ensure that the
    Collaboration is able to further its purpose. If the Chair is
    required to act in an executive capacity, the Chair shall take
    reasonable steps to ensure that the advice of the other Management
    Team members is obtained. The Chair shall report all actions
    undertaken and any decisions taken, either individually or by the
    Management Team, on a regular basis to the Collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Management Team positions are elected two-year positions. Upon
    ratification of these by-laws, the Management Team positions shall
    be divided into two classes. The positions of the first class
    shall be vacated at the end of the existing term of the Management
    Team.<sup>2</sup> The positions of the second class shall be
    vacated one year following the end of the existing term of the
    Management Team. The Management Team shall have at least one
    person based at a Canadian institution and at least one person
    based at a U.S. institution.
    </p>
    <p>
    The previous Chair shall serve on the Management Team in a
    non-voting capacity for at least one year following the expiration
    of that person’s term as Chair.
    </p>
    <p>
    If a member of the Management Team resigns or is no longer a
    member of NANOGrav, an election to replace that member shall be
    conducted as soon as reasonably possible, unless that position of
    the Management Team would have been vacated in less than six
    months.
    </p>
    <p>
    Two Senior Personnel of NANOGrav shall serve on the IPTA Steering
    Committee in order to represent NANOGrav interests. One of the
    positions shall be designated to be also a member of the
    Management Team. The term of the IPTA Steering Committee
    representatives is two years,<sup>3</sup> with one IPTA Steering
    Committee representative elected at the same time as the positions
    of the first class of the Management Team and the second
    representative elected at the same time as the positions of the
    second class of the Management Team.
    </p>
    <p>
    If an IPTA Steering Committee representative resigns or is no
    longer a member of NANOGrav, an election to replace that
    representative shall be conducted as soon as reasonably possible,
    unless that position on the IPTA Steering Committee would have
    been vacated in less than six months.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Management Team is responsible for conducting elections to all
    of these positions. Elections shall be scheduled such that there
    is at least one month between the date of the election and the
    date on which the term of the elected positions begins. One month
    prior to the date of an election, the Management Team shall
    identify the positions to be elected and notify the entire
    Collaboration by email that nominations for these positions can be
    submitted. A person may be nominated for multiple positions, but
    all nominations shall identify the position or positions for which
    a person is being nominated. The Management Team shall verify that
    all persons nominated for a position are eligible to serve in that
    position, if elected. Once the time for voting has expired, the
    Management Team shall notify the entire Collaboration by email of
    the persons elected to the positions as soon as reasonably
    possible, but no later than at least one week prior to the start
    of the new term of the positions.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Working Groups and committees</h3>
    <p>
    The Collaboration organizes its activities into a series of
    Working Groups (WGs). A new WG may be established by the agreement
    of three Full Members. Each WG shall appoint a chair, who will
    serve for a term of one year. A person may serve consecutive terms
    as a WG chair. Any Member of the Collaboration may join a WG by
    contacting the WG chair and requesting to join.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ad-hoc, time-limited committees may be established, as needed, by
    the Management Team to research a specific issue, develop draft
    documents for discussion and approval by the Membership, or for
    other purposes as needed.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Meetings</h3>
    <p>
    NANOGrav shall conduct monthly meetings in order to assess
    progress toward its goals and review any scientific, technical, or
    programmatic issues that may have an impact on its goals. At least
    one meeting per year shall be in person, and other meetings may be
    in person or may use suitable technologies (e.g. teleconferencing,
    video conferencing, or web conferencing).
    </p>
    <p>
    Each WG shall hold regular meetings, with a frequency of at least
    two meetings per year. Meetings may be in person or may use
    suitable technologies (e.g. teleconferencing, video conferencing,
    or web conferencing). All Members are welcome to participate in
    any WG meeting, even if not a formal member of that WG.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Voting</h3>
    <p>
    All votes shall be conducted by secret ballot. Votes shall be by
    email ballot or other suitable technical means (e.g. web poll). A
    minimum of one week shall be allowed for Members to transmit their
    votes. The quorum for a vote is two-thirds of the Members eligible
    to vote on the given question. A supermajority is defined as
    two-thirds of the votes cast.
    </p>
    <p>
    For votes for Officer positions during elections, instant runoff
    voting shall be used. The election ballot shall list each position
    that is contested, with a slate of candidates for each
    position. The names of candidates shall be ordered alphabetically
    by their surnames. Each voter ranks the candidates for each
    position. In the first round, the top-ranked candidate on each
    ballot receives the vote. If a candidate receives a majority of
    the vote, he or she is elected to that position. If no candidate
    receives a majority, the candidate with the smallest number of
    votes is eliminated. The ballots of the eliminated candidate are
    assigned to one of the remaining candidates based on the next
    preference on each ballot. The process repeats until one candidate
    achieves a majority of votes cast.
    </p>
    <p>
    To the extent possible, the Collaboration shall endeavor to act in
    a manner to develop consensus. If a consensus on an issue cannot
    be developed in a reasonable amount of time, the Chair may call
    for a vote on the issue. In any such vote, the motion is carried
    if a majority of the voting Full Members is in agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the following specific items, votes must be conducted with all
    Full Members being eligible to vote:
    <ul>   
      <li>Election of the Chair of NANOGrav</li>
      <li>Election of members of the NANOGrav Management Team</li>
      <li>Election of NANOGrav representatives to the IPTA Steering
      Committee</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    For the following specific actions, votes must be conducted, with
    all Senior Personnel being eligible to vote and the motion being
    carried if a supermajority of the voting Senior Personnel is in
    agreement:
    <ul>
      <li>Adoption of any subsequent policies</li>
      <li>Modification of these by-laws or of any policies</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ratification of these by-laws</li>
      <li>Promotion of Associate Member to Full Membership</li>
      <li>Involuntary conversion of a Full Member to Legacy membership</li>
      <li>Expulsion of a member</li>
      <li>Dissolution of NANOGrav</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>7. Proposals</h3>
    <p>
    The Collaboration shall be notified by email about any proposal
    for the purpose of obtaining funding for the detection or study of
    gravitational waves in which membership or participation in
    NANOGrav is referenced at least one month in advance of the
    proposal’s submission deadline. The notification shall contain at
    least the description of the funding opportunity and the working
    title of the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
    To the extent possible, the Collaboration shall be notified about
    any proposal to obtain observing time on North American telescopes
    for observations directly relevant to NANOGrav goals at least two
    weeks in advance of the proposal deadline, but no later than
    submission of the proposal itself. Any such proposal shall be
    circulated to the Collaboration as soon as possible prior to the
    deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
    The individual who is anticipated to serve as Principal
    Investigator (PI) for the proposal shall provide the notification
    to NANOGrav. In the event that the proposal opportunity allows for
    multiple individuals to serve as Principal Investigators (co-PIs),
    one of the anticipated co-PIs shall provide the notification.
    </p>
    <h3>8. Policies and Procedures</h3>
    <p>
    The Collaboration may adopt policies for specific needs and
    describe procedures to implement them, as warranted, but no policy
    may be proposed that would contravene these by-laws. A policy may
    be proposed by the Management Team or by the agreement of three
    Full Members. At least two meetings of the NANOGrav Collaboration
    shall occur between the proposal of a policy and a vote to ratify
    it. Once adopted, policies may be amended in the same manner as
    these by-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
    If any Member has reason to believe that procedures described in
    these by-laws or policies are not being followed correctly, that
    person is obligated to express his or her concerns to at least one
    member of the Management Team. The Management Team shall report to
    the Collaboration at the next meeting the nature of the concern,
    respecting confidentiality when necessary, and shall report to the
    Collaboration within a reasonable time the manner of its
    resolution.
    </p>
    <h3>9. Communications</h3>
    <p>
    NANOGrav shall maintain an email distribution list for the purpose
    of distributing notifications and other topics of interest to the
    entire Membership. Email distribution lists for subsets of
    NANOGrav members (e.g. Working Groups) may be established as
    needed. Other fora for the interchange and archiving of
    communications, documents, and data shall be established as
    necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
    Any press release related to NANOGrav activities by a member’s
    institution shall be coordinated through the Public/Science
    Community Relations and Outreach WG.
    </p>
    <h3>10. Ratification and Amendments</h3>
    <p>
    An amendment to the by-laws may be suggested at any time by a Full
    Member. At least two meetings of the NANOGrav Collaboration shall
    occur between the proposal of an amendment and a vote to ratify
    it.
    </p>
    <p>
    These by-laws shall come into force upon ratification by a
    supermajority vote of the Senior Personnel of NANOGrav.
