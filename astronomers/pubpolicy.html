  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>Publication Policy</h2>
    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>
    The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
    (NANOGrav) is a collaboration of researchers who are actively
    engaged in using North American radio telescopes to detect and
    study gravitational waves via pulsar timing. The goals of this
    policy are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To ensure the timely dissemination of NANOGrav results</li>
      <li>To ensure that members receive credit for critical NANOGrav work</li>
      <li>To promote the open exchange of ideas within the
	Collaboration and foster collaboration among NANOGrav
	members</li>
      <li>To publicize NANOGrav and its work in the broader scientific
	community</li>
      <li>To increase awareness among all NANOGrav members of projects
	and publications within the Collaboration</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Oversight</h3>
    <p>
    The NANOGrav Management Team is responsible for managing all
    aspects of the publication policy. The Management Team shall
    arbitrate and settle any publication dispute. Authors may appeal
    to the Management Team for exceptions to the publication policy in
    special cases. The Management Team may designate other NANOGrav
    members (individuals or committees) to act on their behalf in
    matters involving publication policy. In such instances, final
    decision-making power remains with the Management Team.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Coverage of Policy</h3>
    <p>
    This policy applies to Junior, Associate, and Full members of
    NANOGrav as defined by the membership policy.
    </p>
    <p>
    The NANOGrav publication policy applies to “NANOGrav
    publications.” This includes all publications produced by NANOGrav
    members involving or motivated by NANOGrav data, pre-publication
    NANOGrav research and research results, or discussions that the
    members may have had as a privilege of their participation in the
    NANOGrav Collaboration. This also includes any publication related
    to NANOGrav science, or which uses NANOGrav-developed tools. The
    scope of “NANOGrav science” is broad and includes, but is not
    limited to, pulsar timing observations and data analysis for
    gravitational wave (GW) detection; detection techniques for GWs;
    astrophysical interpretation of pulsar timing array measurements;
    studies of noise in pulsar signals; and studies of the influence
    of the interstellar medium on pulsar signals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unless specified otherwise, this policy applies to all
    publications, independent of form or venue. This includes, but is
    not limited to, refereed journal articles, conference proceedings,
    technical memos, white papers, arXiv-only publications, and
    student papers.
    </p>
    <h3>4. IPTA Publications</h3>
    <p>
    Publications written under the auspices of the IPTA (International
    Pulsar Timing Array) shall follow IPTA authorship guidelines. We
    encourage such publications to follow policies similar to those
    for NANOGrav measurement/limit papers as outlined in
    Authorship.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Definitions and Types of Publications.</h3>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
      <li><strong>Types of NANOGrav Science and Non-NANOGrav Science
	  Publications</strong></li>
      <p>
      Every publication covered by the NANOGrav publication policy
      falls into one of the following three categories.
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li><strong>NANOGrav GW Measurement/Limit Publications</strong></li>
        <p>
	A NANOGrav GW measurement/limit publication is a publication
	that uses NANOGrav data (and data products, time of arrival
	(TOA), residuals, par files) for the purposes of GW detection
	and/or upper limits (even if the data have been publicly
	released). Such publications include measurements/limits on
	GWs from any source or collection of sources, including
	backgrounds, individual periodic sources, and burst
	sources.
	</p>
        <li><strong>NANOGrav Non-GW Measurement/Limit Publications</strong></li>
        <p>
	This category includes all publications on NANOGrav science
	not giving GW measurements/limits. Such publications are on
	topics related to the NANOGrav goal of detecting, measuring,
	and extracting astrophysical information from GW signals using
	pulsar timing. Such publications include ISM studies, noise
	estimation in timing residuals, data analysis methods,
	detection techniques, astrophysical interpretation, etc.
	</p>
        <li><strong>Non-NANOGrav Science Publications</strong></li>
        <p>
	This category includes all publications which use NANOGrav
	resources as defined in Section 5.b but which are not on
	topics related to NANOGrav science as defined in Sections
	5.a.i and 5.a.ii. An example of such a publication would be a
	paper using NANOGrav data to analyze a binary pulsar to
	measure neutron star masses.
	</p>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Publications Using NANOGrav Data</strong></li>
        <p>
	Publications covered by the NANOGrav publication policy may
	(but need not) fall into one or both of the following
	categories. These definitions are used in authorship policies
	in Authorship.
	</p>
        <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
          <li><strong>Publications Using NANOGrav Data</strong></li>
          <p>
	  A publication that uses NANOGrav data is any publication,
	  whether or not on NANOGrav science as defined in Sections
	  5.a.i and 5.a.ii, that makes use of any data collected for
	  the NANOGrav project, whether or not the data is available
	  to the general public or to other collaborative groups. Such
	  data includes, but is not limited to, pulsar timing array
	  data, supplementary timing observations of individual timing
	  array pulsars, and observations to study other aspects of
	  pulsars that impact NANOGrav science (e.g. ISM studies,
	  individual-pulse studies). The “data team” associated with
	  any given data set are the NANOGrav members who obtained
	  that data or processed it in ways necessary for its use in a
	  publication.
	  </p>
          <li><strong>Publications Using NANOGrav Tools</strong></li>
          <p>
	  A publication that uses NANOGrav tools is any publication,
	  whether or not on NANOGrav science as defined in Sections
	  5.a.i and 5.a.ii, that uses any software, simulation, or
	  other tool developed for the NANOGrav project, whether or
	  not that tool is publicly available. The “developers”
	  associated with any given tool are the NANOGrav members who
	  had a significant role in developing that tool.
	  </p>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <h3>6. Authorship</h3>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
      <li><strong> NANOGrav GW Measurement/Limit Publications as
	  Defined in Section 5.a.i</strong></li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>
	  The authorship of a NANOGrav measurement/limit publication,
	  except for posters and presentations as described in first
	  paragraph of Authorship, shall consist of NANOGrav Full
	  Members, NANOGrav Legacy Members during their first year of
	  Legacy status, and all others who contributed significantly
	  to the publication. Authors shall be listed alphabetically
	  in order of surname.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Author lists for NANOGrav GW measurement/limit posters, oral
	  presentations (e.g. seminars, colloquia, and conference
	  presentations), and conference proceedings shall be authored
	  by the presenter(s) for the NANOGrav Collaboration
	  (e.g. “Jane Doe for the NANOGrav Collaboration”). Additional
	  individual authors may be named only with approval of the
	  Management Team.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>NANOGrav Non-GW Measurement/Limit Publications as
	  Defined in Section 5.a.ii</strong></li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>
	  Author lists shall include all people who make significant
	  contributions to the publication.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Author lists may include specific groups as described in
	  Sections 6.d.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Author order shall be determined by the authors
	  themselves. A typical situation may be a short list of those
	  who make the most significant contributions to the
	  publication followed by an alphabetical list of those with
	  more ancillary roles.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Author lists for posters, oral presentations, and conference
	  proceedings that are NANOGrav non-GW-measurement/limit
	  publications may include full author lists or may be
	  abbreviated, e.g. “Jane Doe for the NANOGrav detection
	  group” at the discretion of the authors.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Publications Not on NANOGrav Science Using NANOGrav
	  Resources as Defined in Section 5.a.iii</strong></li>
        <p>
	Publications by NANOGrav members which use NANOGrav resources
	(data or tools) for non-NANOGrav science are subject to the
	authorship policies governing NANOGrav data and NANOGrav tools
	given in Section 6.d but are not governed by other authorship
	rules in the NANOGrav publication policy.
	</p>
      <li><strong>Publications Using NANOGrav Data or Tools</strong></li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>
	  Publications that use NANOGrav data or NANOGrav tools that
	  are not publicly available shall include the relevant data
	  team or tool developers as authors.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Publications that use NANOGrav data or NANOGrav tools that
	  are publicly available should consult with the relevant data
	  team or tool developers regarding potential
	  co-authorship. For guidance, the corresponding author of a
	  paper or the major participants in a project may consult
	  with the Management Team.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Publications that use small amounts of published NANOGrav
	  data for illustrative purposes (e.g. for a new detection
	  technique), but which do not present new GW
	  limits/detections, need not include data-takers among the
	  authors.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Authors may appeal to the Management Team for exceptions to
	the authorship policy as stated in Section 2</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>7. Conferences and Presentations</h3>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
      <li><strong>Circulation of Abstracts, Titles, and Author
	  Lists</strong></li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>
	  Conference and poster abstracts, titles, and author lists,
	  for presentation on NANOGrav science topics as defined in
	  Sections 5.a.i and 5.a.ii, shall be circulated to the
	  NANOGrav Collaboration via email at least one week before
	  submission to the conference organizers.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Only abstracts for talks or posters on behalf of the
	  NANOGrav Collaboration (i.e. “Jane Doe for the NANOGrav
	  Collaboration”) shall require Management Team
	  approval. Other types of abstracts for talks and posters do
	  not require such approval, but should be circulated to the
	  Collaboration as described in Section 7.a.i.
	</li>
        <li>
	  All circulated abstracts shall be gathered on the NANOGrav
	  document repository.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Presentations Including a GW Measurement/Limit</strong></li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li><strong>Circulation and Approval</strong></li>
        <p>
	No poster or oral presentation (e.g. seminar, colloquium,
	conference presentation), nor any abstract for such, may make
	a quantitative statement about GW measurement/limits derived
	from NANOGrav data without the express approval of the
	Management Team, unless the result has already been published
	in an archival journal or on the arXiv, or unless the
	quantitative statement is on a list of approved
	measurement/limit statements maintained by the Management Team
	on the NANOGrav wiki. This approval must be obtained at least
	one week prior to the presentation. Any unpublished results
	shall be labeled as “preliminary.” Such presentations shall be
	circulated to the entire Collaboration, in draft form, one
	week before the presentation is given.
	</p>
        <li><strong>Posting of Presentation Slides and
            Recordings</strong></li>
        <p>
	Some conferences and seminar series routinely post
	presentation slides and/or video recordings of presentations
	on the Internet. Presentations that include NANOGrav GW
	measurement/limit statements that are part of such a
	conference or series may be posted on the Internet under the
	same restrictions described for presentations in Section
	7.b.i.
	</p>
        <li><strong>Conference Proceedings Including a GW
            Measurement/Limit</strong></li>
	<p>
	Conference proceedings that are NANOGrav GW measurement/limit
	publications may not be submitted until the main NANOGrav GW
	detection/upper limit paper that describes the results is on
	the arXiv or published.
	</p>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Archiving of Presentations</strong></li>
      <p>
      All presentations shall be gathered on the NANOGrav document
      repository.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h3>8. Student Publications</h3>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
      <li><strong>Definition</strong></li>
      <p>
      A “student publication” is a thesis (graduate or undergraduate),
      term paper, or other publication primarily or exclusively
      written by a student for submission to an educational
      institution for academic purposes.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Authorship</strong></li>
      <p>
      Student publications may be authored by a single author (the
      student). Such publications shall acknowledge other contributors
      to the work.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Student Publications Including a GW
	  Measurement/Limit</strong></li>
      <p>
      Student publications shall not be the first presentation of a
      new GW measurement or new astrophysically significant GW upper
      limit.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Circulation</strong></li>
      <p>
      Student publications shall be circulated to the Collaboration
      one week before submission. The purpose of circulation is to
      make the Collaboration aware of the student work and to allow
      the student to receive feedback on the publication. However, the
      student supervisor, not the Collaboration, is ultimately
      responsible for reviewing student work.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h3>9. Review and Submission Procedures</h3>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
      <li>
	A corresponding author shall be designated by those working
	most closely on any given publication in consultation with the
	Management Team.
      </li>
      <li>
	The corresponding author is charged with ensuring that the
	NANOGrav review and submission procedures are followed for the
	publication.
      </li>
      <li>
	The corresponding author along with the co-authors working
	most closely on the publication have the responsibility for
	the entire paper as an accurate, verifiable, report on the
	research.
      </li>
      <li>
	Publications which do not arise from pre-existing projects
	should be placed on the project list in a timely manner.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Circulation</strong></li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>
	  Rough draft manuscripts shall be circulated within the
	  NANOGrav Collaboration for a minimum of one week for
	  discussion of major content issues.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Draft manuscripts shall be circulated within NANOGrav for a
	  minimum of one additional week for discussion of minor
	  content issues, for a total of at least two weeks of
	  circulation before submission to a journal (or publication
	  in another form).
	</li>
        <li>
	  Early and frequent circulation of outlines and manuscripts
	  is strongly encouraged, however. The circulation time-scales
	  in Sections 9.e.i and 9.e.ii should be regarded as an
	  absolute minimum.
	</li>
        <li>
	  All Collaboration members may suggest changes to the content
	  and author list.
	</li>
        <li>
	  Non-authors may not distribute draft manuscripts further
	  without permission of authors.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <li>
	The corresponding author shall share editorial correspondence
	with all other authors on any given publication (not
	necessarily the full NANOGrav Collaboration).
      </li>
      <li>
	If major changes in content are required during the refereeing
	process, the manuscript shall be circulated as described in
	Section 9.e.
      </li>
      <li>
	For refereed papers, the corresponding author shall notify the
	NANOGrav Collaboration when the paper is accepted.
      </li>
      <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
        <li>
	  A database of NANOGrav publications with bibliographic
	  information shall be maintained.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h3>10. Project List</h3>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
      <li>
	Student and other projects by NANOGrav members on NANOGrav
	related science shall be listed on the NANOGrav wiki.
      </li>
      <li>
	Such projects, including graduate student projects, shall be
	protected from prior publication by others provided the
	project is completed in timely manner.
      </li>
      <li>
	The status and progress of all unfinished projects and
	unpublished publications, including graduate student projects,
	shall be reviewed at regular intervals by the Working Group
	(WG) chairs who shall report to the Management Team.
      </li>
      <li>
	Anyone who has made significant contributions to a project in
	NANOGrav forums and WGs may propose themselves as an author on
	papers which arise from that project.
      </li>
      <li>
	Information about projects in progress shall not be circulated
	beyond the NANOGrav Collaboration except by the project
	team.
