  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>Introduction to NANOGrav</h2> 
    <p>
    NANOGrav (<u>N</u>orth <u>A</u>merican <u>N</u>anohertz
    <u>O</u>bservatory for <u>Grav</u>itational Waves) is a
    collaboration of scientists working to detect and study very low
    frequency (about nanohertz) gravitational waves.  Using an array
    of high-precision millisecond pulsars, we seek to measure the
    influence of gravitational waves on the Earth.  At these
    frequencies, we expect to detect a stochastic background of
    merging supermassive black holes, individual inspiral and merger
    events, and possibly cosmic strings and inflationary gravitational
    waves.  NANOGrav consists of astrophysicists at over a dozen
    institutions throughout the United States and Canada.  We count
    among our ranks senior faculty and researchers, postdoctoral
    scholars, graduate and undergraduate students, and even high
    school students through our educational and outreach partnerships.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are serveral ways to get involved in NANOGrav.  We invite
    any interested scientists and students to give a talk at one of
    our monthly science seminars, and we welcome collaboration with
    scientists in fields relevant to NANOGrav.  Interested scientists
    should consult the NANOGrav <a href="membership.html">Membership
    Policy</a> and <a href="leadership.html#bylaws">Bylaws</a> for
    more information.
    </p>
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
    Millisecond pulsars rotate with incredible stability, allowing
    them to be used as precise clocks.  The time of arrival (TOA) of a
    pulse can usually be measured to &delta;/(S/N), where &delta; is
    the pulse width (typically a few hundred microseconds) and S/N is
    the signal-to-noise.  For many millisecond pulsars, this results
    in TOAs measured with &#8818; few &mu;s precision.  TOAs are used
    to construct a timing model that is coherent in pulse phase,
    i.e. it accounts for every single rotation of the pulsar by
    modeling the rotational, astrometric, and (when applicable) binary
    parameters of the system.  The residuals in these timing models
    (the difference between the predicted and measured TOAs) can have
    an RMS scatter as little as 100 nanoseconds over timescales of
    many years.

    </p>
    <p>
    NANOGrav seeks to detect and study gravitational waves by looking
    for their influence in timing residuals from an array of
    ultra-precise millisecond pulsars.  Gravitational waves passing
    through the Solar system will lead to correlations in the timing
    residuals between pairs of pulsars, even though the influence on
    the pulsars themselves will not be correlated across the array.
    This "Earth term" depends only on the baseline between pulsar
    pairs and is given by the Hellings-Downs curve.  We are sensitive
    to gravitational waves with periods between the cadence of pulsar
    timing observations (weeks) to the span of our dataset (years),
    which corresponds to nanohertz frequencies.  This allows NANOGrav
    to probe a unique phase space that is complementary to
    interferometric gravitational wave detectors.  The sensitive of
    our array increases as we add more pulsars, improve TOA precision
    and the RMS of our timing residuals (which depend on
    instrumentation and our understanding of the pulsars and
    propogation effects through the interstellar medium), and time.
    The latter factor is thanks to the expected nature of the
    gravitational wave spectrum, which increases in amplitude as we
    move to lower frequencies.
